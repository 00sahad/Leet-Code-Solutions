# Leetcode solutions üò∫

Hi Brothers and sisters, I Little bit started learning Data structures & Algorithms. As you know i'm working with Java script so i decided to solving problems using Java script. till now, i solved more than 100 problems. i updated each of them in git hub. my achivements are given below.

## My journey

I have been solving leet code problems more than 1 year. I started DSA with learning the basics of the popular data structures such as Array, Linked list, Stack, Queue etc also solved some basic questions. about leet code, in my early stage i focus on questions which tagged easy. it is a good practice that starting with easy questions also java script has a lot of built-in functionalities utrlize them. i sovled almost 100 questions just like that. then i started learning data structures and solving leet code questions again, now i just completed learning binary search and some of it's variants then started solving questions tagged binary search , easy and medium. if i stuck somewhere i depend youtube videos and understand under the hood i solved alsost 15 questions just like that. in conclution, i almost solved 170 + questions.  

## Result

Through solving these problems my entire problem-solving skill changed. now if i get any question, i'll get many ideas to solve the problem. not only in the coding problems the entire way of solving real-life software related problems that can be anything. as a beginned i definety suggest solving these kind of problems. just start solving.
